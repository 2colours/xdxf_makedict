After or before installation you should put "codecs" to 
somewhere like "/usr/share/makedict/codecs". 
"codecs" is executable files except makedict in "src" subdirectory.

After that add "export MAKEDICT_PLUGIN_DIR=/usr/share/makedict/codecs"
somewhere into ~/.bashrc.
After that if you want parse "dictd" file, you should type
makedict -o stardict file.index
or 
makedict -o xdxf path/file.index
"makedict" create directory "path/file" and 
put result of work to this directory.
