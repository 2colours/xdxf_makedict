- more good solution for lang table: put table also here, convert to not std::pair array
- handle ['] tag in dsl
- xml -> text when converting to stardict and dictd
- do not use `exit' to terminate program
- check all to do items in code
- do not use external program except standard one in tests
- xdxf_parser - how report about error?
- dsl: for what used dict.utr files?
- port to win32?
- more good message about wrong dsl "{{ comment }" - not closed comment
